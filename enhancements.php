	<h2>Enhancements</h2>
	<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and</p>
	<p>typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's</p>
	<p>standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown</p>
	<p>printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type</p>
	<p>specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also</p>
	<p>the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially</p>
	<p>unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of</p>
	<p>Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more</p>
	<p>recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker</p>
	<p>including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
